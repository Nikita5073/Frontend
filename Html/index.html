    <h1>India is my country</h1>

    <p><b>India</b> is a land of various cultures and a <i>rich heritage</i> . It is the <u>seventh-largest</u> country by area and the second-most populous country globally. The peacock is India's national bird, and the Bengal tiger is the country's national animal.</p>
    <h1><center>Culture of india</center></h1>
    <p>The cultural diversity in India<ins>nikita</ins> refers to the variety of cultures and societies. It indicates the customs, beliefs, ideas, and social attributes of people. There are many different communities in India that differ markedly from each other. The more prominent cultural differences that exist between the people of India are, the languages, traditions, dressing styles and food habits. Different religions influence Indian culture and the amalgamation of various cultures and traditions is evident across India</p>
    <h1>Corruption of india</h1>
    <p>Corruption is a form of dishonesty or a criminal offense which is undertaken by a person or an organization which is entrusted in a position of authority, in order to acquire illicit benefits or abuse power for one's personal gain. Corruption may involve many activities which include bribery, influence peddling and embezzlement and it may also involve practices which are legal in many countries.[1] Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts with an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most common in kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco-states, and mafia states</p>
    <h1>Pollution</h1>
    <p>All of us love our country and have a strong attachment to this ancient land of ours. We want to see a prosperous and happy India. Each one of us has a dream of how India should develop and progress. Just as Jawaharlal Nehru, our first Prime Minister had said at the time of independence that he had to solve 300 million problems (the population of India at that time); similarly, each one of us may have thought about the “India of my dreams”.</p>
    <h1>Employment Opportunities</h1>
    <p>Creating employment opportunities for youth is one of the key factors that contribute to the development of a nation. India which I dream of should have enormous opportunities for youth so they can be easily employed. There should be jobs in every sector so that one can work in the area of his/her interest. In this way, India will reach great heights.</p>
    <h1>Women Empowerment</h1>
    <p>The India of my dreams includes women who are respected everywhere. They have power and rights equal to men. They are treated as an extremely important member of the family where they can take decisions and have financial independence.</p>
    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>I dream of India as a country where everyone has access to education. There are children who belong to poor families and cannot afford education because of the costs of education. For such children, education should be provided freely. Moreover, education should be provided irrespective of gender discrimination. The girl child should be given equal opportunities similar to the boy child.</p>
    <h1>Festival</h1>
    <p>Indian culture refers to the amalgamation of distinct and unique cultures of all religions and communities that exist in India. India is a diverse country and the customs, traditions, food, music, religion and dance differs from place to place within the nation. The diversity in Indian culture is known across the world.

        India is multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-lingual and multi-religious society. People in India speak different languages and have diverse lingual tones. Various languages such as Hindi, Gujarati, English, Tamil, Sindhi, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Manipuri and Marathi are spoken in India. It is home to people of diverse cultures, backgrounds and lifestyles</p>
        <h1>Poverty</h1>
        <p>There is a lot of economic disparity in the country. The rich here are becoming richer, and the poor are becoming poorer by the day. I dream of India, where wealth is equally distributed among the citizens.</p>
        <h1>Casteism</h1>
        <p>Casteism is another major issue that needs to be worked upon. India of my dreams would be a place where people are not discriminated against based on their caste, creed, or religion.</p>
